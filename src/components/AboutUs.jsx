            <h4>Increasing educational equity in STEM</h4>
            The same high-quality, fun version of RightOn! is available for all students – no matter your school, zip code, or how much you even like math.

            <h4>Fostering mathematical mindsets</h4>
            Everyone can get better at math, especially when you try. We focus on wrong answers rather than right ones, so anyone who has ever come up with a wrong answer can play this game!

            RightOn! Is not just any game, it’s a game show where you can play in teams and win prizes – real ones!
